## Ways to Contribute

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Open an issue first if the bug isn't already reported
- Include the code snippet that triggers it + expected vs actual behavior

### ✨ New Bug Detection Patterns
Bug patterns live in `backend/app/services/code_assistant.py` in the `BUG_PATTERNS` list.

Each pattern is a `BugPattern` dataclass:

```python
BugPattern(
    name="Pattern Name",
    pattern=r"regex_to_match",
    description="What the bug is and why it's a problem.",
    suggestion="How to fix it — be specific and actionable.",
    severity="error",        # "error" | "warning" | "info"
    languages=["Python"],    # which languages this applies to
)
```

After adding a pattern, add a test in `backend/tests/test_endpoints.py`:

```python
def test_debug_detects_your_pattern():
    r = client.post("/debugging/", json={"code": "...trigger code...", "language": "python"})
    assert r.status_code == 200
    types = [i["type"] for i in r.json()["issues"]]
    assert "Pattern Name" in types
```

### 💡 New Suggestion Rules
Suggestion logic is in the `run_suggestions()` function in `code_assistant.py`. Add a new `if` block that appends to the `suggestions` list.

### 🎨 Frontend Improvements
The entire frontend is `frontend/index.html` — one self-contained file. No build step, no Node.js required. Just edit and open in your browser.

### 📖 Documentation
- Fix typos, improve clarity, add examples
- Update the README if you add/change a feature
- Add docstrings to functions that lack them

### 🧪 Tests
- Add test cases for edge cases
- Improve coverage for existing features
- Parametrize tests where appropriate

## Code Standards

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8. Run `ruff check backend/app` before committing.
- **Type hints**: All new Python functions must have type annotations.
- **Docstrings**: All public functions and classes need docstrings.
- **Tests**: Every new feature or bug fix needs a corresponding test.
- **No secrets**: Never commit API keys, passwords, or credentials.
